MSCA 31013 Big Data Platforms  

This course teaches students how to approach Big Data and large-scale machine learning applications. While there is no single definition of Big Data and multiple emerging software packages exist to work with Big Data, we will cover the most popular approaches. Students will learn the Big Data infrastructure, including Linux, Massive parallelization and Distributed Computing, and how to apply both Hadoop and Spark map-reduce concepts for clustering, similarity search, web analytics and classification. During the course, we will cover the applications of NoSQL systems, such as JSON stores, object storage and Elasticsearch. The cloud computing section of the course will focus on virtualization and container orchestration, including virtual machines, dockers and Kubernetes. During the course students will gain hands-on expertise leveraging Hive, Pig, Python and PySpark for Big Data applications in client-server environment.
