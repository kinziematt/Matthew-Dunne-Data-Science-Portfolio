# Course Description

The goal in this course is to provide you with increasingly challenging assignments, where the first assignment is relatively simple, and by the end of the four weeks you are completing a real-world data science project suitable for putting in a portfolio to show prospective employers. Because of this, the majority of assignments in this course are autograded programming assignments.  

All assignments for this course require a 80% grade to pass, but some assignments have questions which build upon earlier questions. If you're not sure what kind of output is required, or think there is a need for more clarity, please head to the course discussion forums. Note that some assignments and in video quizzes may not be mobile friendly.
