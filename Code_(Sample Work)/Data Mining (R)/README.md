MSCA 31008 Data Mining Principles  

Drawing on statistics of collecting and analyzing data, and machine learning algorithms that learn from experiences, data mining is a process of applying statistics and machine learning algorithms to discover patterns and rules that can generate business values. This course will introduce students to the common algorithms: association and sequence rules discovery, memory-based reasoning, clustering, classification and regression decision trees, logistic models, and neural network models. In addition, students will learn how to compare analytical results and give recommendations during the data mining process. In addition to assignments and tests, students are required to propose and complete a data mining research project of their own design.
