# Big Data Project Description  

You have several thousand Twitter files loaded into '/user/ivy2/Tweets/'. This is live collection, so depending on when you complete the analysis, the results might be slightly different.  Once you combine the files, there will be over 60M records, most of these records are related to either “Chicago” or “University”, but only a small fraction of these would be directly related to the University of Chicago.  

Your objective is to identify the profiles of Twitter users, who are tweeting about University of Chicago and compare them to the profiles of Twitter users who are tweeting about other universities.  You want to make actionable business recommendations to help University improve the social media outreach programs.  

# Data Mining Project Description  

This project is based on a **Kaggle competition**, which is described as follows:  

The Inter-American Development Bank is asking the Kaggle community for help with income qualification for some of the world's poorest families. Are you up for the challenge?  

Here's the backstory: Many social programs have a hard time making sure the right people are given enough aid. It’s especially tricky when a program focuses on the poorest segment of the population. The world’s poorest typically can’t provide the necessary income and expense records to prove that they qualify.  

In Latin America, one popular method uses an algorithm to verify income qualification. It’s called the Proxy Means Test (or PMT). With PMT, agencies use a model that considers a family’s observable household attributes like the material of their walls and ceiling, or the assets found in the home to classify them and predict their level of need.  

While this is an improvement, accuracy remains a problem as the region’s population grows and poverty declines.  

To improve on PMT, the IDB (the largest source of development financing for Latin America and the Caribbean) has turned to the Kaggle community. They believe that new methods beyond traditional econometrics, based on a dataset of Costa Rican household characteristics, might help improve PMT’s performance.  


# NLP Project  

Illinois is famous for being one of the very few states in the country with negative population growth.  The objective of your final project is to:  

1.	Identify the key reasons for the declining population by extracting meaningful insights from unstructured text  
2.	Provide actionable recommendations on what can be done to reverse this trend  

You have a collection of a couple of months’ worth of news articles in RCC located at: /project/msca/kadochnikov/news/news_chicago_il.pkl  

# Time Series Project  

Shanghai uses an auction system to sell a limited number of license plates to fossil-fuel car buyers every month. The average price of this license plate is about $13,000 and it is often referred to as "the most expensive piece of metal in the world." So, our goal is to predict the avg price or the lowest price for the next month. This Data set will be updated every month constantly.
